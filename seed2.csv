"Buyer: Hello. I saw your ad. I really would like to buy it for my kid. Is it a reliable equipment Seller: It is in great condition.  I would be willing to deliver it to you! Buyer: Great and do you have it in different colors? Seller: I only have the blue one, but it is in like new condition. Buyer: Okay, I can still use that, but now the price is an issue for me. What can we do about that? Seller: well, I will throw in free delivery and a 3 month warranty for the $100. Buyer: I can't afford $100 because I am not working full time. I just have a certain budget. I can only pay $76 for it Seller: That is a really big difference!  I will also throw in a helmet and bring the price down to $95.  So, you will get the bike, the helmet, delivery, and a 3 month warranty.  I feel that this is more than fair.  Wouldn't you agree? Buyer: I would appreciate if you waive the other options as I just want the bike for my kid. Can we work $80 for it? Seller: Can we split the difference and agree on 87.50? Buyer: okay I think I can do that by taking in more hours at work at least my kid will be happy :) Seller: Agreed, thank you! Buyer:  Seller: ",bike
